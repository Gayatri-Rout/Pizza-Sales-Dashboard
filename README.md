Welcome to my Pizza Sales Dashboard project! This document serves as a guide to understanding the setup, data analysis, and visualization techniques used in this project.

### Problem Statement
For this project, I aimed to analyze pizza sales data to gain insights into business performance. The goal was to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualize trends using Power BI.

### KPI's Requirement
To assess our business performance, I identified the following KPIs:

4. **Total Orders**: Total number of orders placed.
5. **Average Pizzas Per Order**: Average number of pizzas sold per order.

### Charts Requirement
In addition to KPIs, I wanted to visualize various aspects of our pizza sales data. The following charts were identified for this purpose:
1. **Daily Trend for Total Orders**: Bar chart displaying the daily trend of total orders over a specific time period.
2. **Monthly Trend for Total Orders**: Line chart illustrating the hourly trend of total orders throughout the day.
3. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category**: Pie chart showing the distribution of sales across different pizza categories.

1. **Data Import and Database Setup**: 
   - Imported data into MySQL for storage and analysis.

2. **Data Analysis with MySQL**:
   - Performed various queries to extract relevant information for analysis.

3. **Connect MySQL to Power BI**:
   - Connected MySQL database to Power BI to visualize the data.

4. **Data Cleaning and KPI Building in Power BI**:
   - Conducted basic data cleaning to ensure data quality.
   - Calculated key performance indicators (KPIs) using DAX formulas.

5. **Chart Creation in Power BI**:
   - Created relevant and insightful charts to visualize the data as per the requirements stated.
